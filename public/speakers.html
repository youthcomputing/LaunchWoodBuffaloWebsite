                        Jon founded the Community Futures Network of Alberta. In this role he provided strategic leadership, expertise and support as well as added-value to the Boards, Management and Staff serving rural Alberta through each of the 27 Community Futures organizations in the province of Alberta. On a macro-level, his role was also to partner in the provision of leadership and support the CF program as it operates across Canada.  From 1988 until 1996, Jon was the founding General Manager of a highly successful Community Futures organization based in Medicine Hat, Alberta and serving the south-east region of the province. The role involved providing community economic development leadership and support to communities within the region. As part of that role, the 20 person operation provided access to capital for SMEs, business coaching/training, as well as support with business planning.  Jon is now fully-engaged as Principal and Co-Founder of UpClose Team where he leverages his experience and skills as a communicator, trainer and coach to adding value and support to individuals, companies and groups. His focus is on personal, board and leader development.

                        Babs holds degrees in both archaeology (University of Calgary) and museum studies (University of Leicester). In the course of her adventures, she has done fieldwork in Jordan and Nicaragua; lived in an apartment converted from a hayloft once used by Land Army Girls on the estate where the richest Anglo Saxon burial ground was located; helped hundreds of children explore the Lethbridge river valley; taught senior citizens how to use iPads to explore historic photographs; and volunteered with many organizations like the Crowsnest Pass Adult Education Society, Girl Guides of Canada, Crowsnest Regional Library, FCSS and the Lethbridge Food Bank.
At FuseSocial, Babs works with dozens of community agencies to help them find the tools they need to do their work. If an agency needs help with creating a business plan, policies, brainstorming ways to sell themselves, working on strategy or processes, brushing up their board members on how to be effective governors, or working towards national best practices then Babs is the Rosalind Russell to your Cary Grant: in other words, she’s your girl Friday!

                        Steven Niehaus was born and raised in Edmonton and began to study culinary arts right out of high school. Steve trained with some of Canada’s great chefs and soon began to seek aspirations of one day owning his own restaurant. He traveled overseas to Switzerland and to the Caribbean in Grand Cayman, and soon became the chef of a Edmonton restaurant, The Creperie, after moving back home to Canada.
In 1998, Steve moved to Fort McMurray to become the chef of the former Mackenzie Park Inn, now the Quality Hotel. After leaving the industry for a 2 year period, he returned to cooking and started his entrepreneur dream by buying Mitchells Café with his wife. They operated Mitchell's for 11 years and then moved onto the Royal Canadian Legion after selling their shares in Mitchell’s to their partner.
After the fire of 2016, Steve made the commitment to reinvest in Fort McMurray and opened STACs Fine Food as a café and catering service.
Steve has three grown children in Calgary and loves his new home town of Fort McMurray where he enjoys time with his wife and three dogs.

Jennifer was raised in Montreal and graduated from Lasalle College in Fashion Marketing and won first place in the prestigious Entreprise Mode business contest. Due to that win, she quickly got offered a job straight out of school and worked in the fashion industry for many after.

From there, she moved to Fort McMurray to pursue a job in marketing outside of the fashion industry which led her to Cooper & Company Law Firm. 

With her entrepreneurial mindset and her new skill in corporate law, she started her own company, Grace and Market. 

Jennifer still works full time at McMurray Gospel Assembly, however, outside of working hours she keeps herself busy working as the Director of Marketing for the Fort McMurray Monarchs Football Team as well as recently getting hired to be the Marketing Coordinator for the Wood Buffalo Football League. She also has a large clientele of locally owned businesses such as Earls and Myco Electric as well as clientele across Canada and the United States.

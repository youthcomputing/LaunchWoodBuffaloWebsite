                        Jennifer Kennett is Programming Director at Fuse Social. With over 12 years
of experience in Human Resources through various sectors: private business,
industry and municipal government, Jennifer found herself leaning away from
corporate life and seeking the opportunity to make a difference in our
community.
A pivotal moment in her career was when she was accepted into the
Leadership Wood Buffalo cohort for 2017/2018 and, from there, work stopped
being work and she stepped into a sector that she loves.
Living in the urban Centre of Fort McMurray with her husband, Danny, and 2
daughters, Annabelle and Emilie, Jennifer has 4 generations of family residing
in the region. Her roots run deep in Wood Buffalo and she strives to empower
those that she meets to become greater versions of themselves and to build
meaningful relationships with various stakeholders and community members.
Being that these are Jennifer’s strengths, it only makes sense that she would
be drawn to FuseSocial where she can help strengthen Social Profits to
provide the greatest impact for our region.

                        Roberts’ hope to help SME’s (Small to Medium Enterprises) reach their full potential and innovation
                        goals to ensure a robust, resilient and diverse Albertan economy while maintaining our clean water and
